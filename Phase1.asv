%% Phase 1: Data Generation
% This section is related to baseband modulation and demodulation. 
% Here the binary data will be generated and will be transmitted through an additive white Gaussian noise channel with different SNR values. 
% The bit error rate performance will be analysed and plotted against various SNR values.

% Assume the number of bits for transmission is 1024 (means, N= 1024).
% Generate random binary digits (0 or 1)
% Convert binary digits to Â±1 (means 1 to +1 and 0 to -1). This is your data for transmission.

N_bits = 1024 ;
Data = randi([0 1], 1 , N_bits);
Signal =  2 .* (Data * 0.5);

% Generate equal number of noise samples.
% The generated noise should have normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance (use the function randn in MATLAB).
Noise = randn(1, N_bits);


% Change the noise variance with respect to SNR (signal to noise ratio) value.
% For that, fix the SNR value, (For example, let SNR = 10 dB)
% Repeat the steps for different SNRs
% Repeat the steps from noise addition to bit error rate computation
% Do the simulation for the same data set with different SNRs
% Consider different SNR values from 0 dB to 50 dB (in multiples of 5 dB).
% Use SNR value to generate noise variance.
% SNR (in dB) = 10log10 (S/N) where S is the Signal power (or variance) and N is the Noise power (or variance)
% Assume signal (the input data) has unit power. That is, S=1. 
% Obtain the noise variance (=N) from the previous relation and use it together with the noise samples to generate the required noise.
SNR_Array = 0:5:50;
Result = zeros([1 11]);
SignalPower_variance = 1;

for k = 1:length(SNR_Array)
    SNR = SNR_Array(k);

    NoisePower_variance = SignalPower_variance ./ (10 .^ (SNR/10));

    Noise = sqrt(NoisePower_variance) .* Noise;

    %  Add noise samples with transmitted data. This is assumed as your received signal.
    Signal_Received = Signal + Noise;

    % Consider a threshold logic at the receiver.
    % Fix the threshold value as 0 (the transmitted data is +1 and -1, and 0 is the mid value)
    Threshold = 0;
    
    % If the received signal is above or equal to the threshold level, take it as 1
    % If the received signal is below the threshold value, take it as 0.
    
    Output = zeros(1,N_bits);
    Error_Count = 0;
    for i = 1:N_bits
        if (Signal_Received(i) > Threshold)
            Output(i) = 1;
        else
            Output(i) = 0;
        end
    end
    
    % Compute the bit error rate during transmission.
    % Compare the output values from the threshold logice with the input binary digits (1 or 0 format)
    % Compute the bit error rate using the relation Bit error rate = (number of errors during transmission)/(total number of bits for transmission)
    
    for i = 1:N_bits
        if Output(i) ~= Data(k) 
            Error_Count = Error_Count + 1;
        end
    end
    
    Bit_Error_Rate = Error_Count ./ N_bits;
    Result(k) = Bit_Error_Rate;
